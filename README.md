# Sentiment-Analysis-for-IMDB-Movie-Review
A binary classification problem that analyses the sentiment of a movie based on IMDB movie reviews.

In this project, we use sentiment analysis on a set of movie reviews and try to infer their opinion of the movie. We have obtained predictions without feature extractions and after extractions. We also have tabulated the performance of various machine learning algorithms. The algorithms we have discussed are 
  1. Support Vector Machine
  2. K-nearest neighbor
  3. Random Forest
  4. Logistic Regression. 
And also used principal components analysis to reduce the dimensions of the dataset
